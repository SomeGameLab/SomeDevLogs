//////////////////////VERSION 1.1//////////////////////////////
///////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////

		PROJECT STATUS
-Had no majour obstacles to completeing this weeks goals
-Creating the lighting framework wasn't a difficult as expected.
-I was able to use the extra time to improve lighting performance and add more sprites
-New working title for the game 'From the Clouds' inspired by new story ideas;
-New campaign ideas for the main story "From The Clouds"
	-Player spawns in a small mountain town
	-Dark Ominous Clouds settle in around the town
	-Deamons start spawning from underneath the clouds and invading the town at night
	-The player must walk under the clouds to remove them and reveal several mobs that will need to be defeated to reclaim that area
	-once an area has been reclaimed the player will be able to use that area for growing their crops or building buildings;


		NEW CONCEPTS / IDEAS
 have a 'view port' that holds a cache of entities within view
	- allows collision to be called on just the items visible rather than checking every entity
- animated Lighting
	- adding animation to static lighting would greatly improve the effect with only a small performance impact
	- utilese the AnimatedSprite class that is used by mobs to animate movment;
-Hud Selection on Hud Hovered
	-the engine needs a way of knowing which panel is in the users focus
	-if a pannel is not hidden it must be in focus
	-for multiple panels the panel that has the mouse hovering over it will be in focus
	-for overlapping pannels... should there be overlapping pannels?.. 
-Weather effects 
	-rain / snow/ hail / storm / sunny / partly sunny/
-After effects
	-screen shake horizontal / vertical / diagonal
	-screen rumble - randomized screen shake
	-fade screen - fade in / fade out
-Zoom
	-pan the camera up and down to 'zoom' on the sceen
-Notifications system
	-have written notification appear at the top of the screen when ever an event happens 
	i.e. 'your game was saved' , 'you did 25 magic damage', '35 gold recieved'


////////////////NEW THIS WEEK/////////////////////////////////////////
		ENGINE DEVELOPMENT
-Implemented a dynamic lighting framework, worked out much faster and easier to implement than expected;
-Dynamic lighting is being run purely by the cpu and is a little unoptimized to say the least;
	-caching and gpu utilization will greatily improve performance here;
-Implemented a static lighting system based on the dynamic lighting framework;
	-static lighting works extremlly efficiently with almost no noticiable impact to performance even with large numbers of static lights
-Added a Day / Night cycle based on the dynamic lighting famerwork;
	-Improved the day nigth cycle to tint the ambient lighting when apropriate 
		-i.e. slight red / orange tint at evenings, slight blue tint for morinings
-Incorperated the dynamic lighting into the map editor so lights can now be PickedNPainted
-Looked into implementing dynamic zoom for the game.
	-Not impossible but will require some major work arounds or changes to the engine
	-Was able to get some dynamic zooming happening but decided to revert the changes and find a better solution at a later date

	-8 new birch trees
	-8 new dead trees
	-8 new ficus trees
