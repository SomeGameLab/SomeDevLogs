/*
		AMBITION
-create a top down retro style rpg that features a large open world with many quests and dungeons to complete.
-a diverse world with unique environmental areas and specific enemeys to those environments i.e. grass biome spawns bunnys and butterflys .
-Begin in a small town which can be expanded over time by constructing new buildings and having npcs join your town
-NPCs that join your town will be listed in the towns population and can be commanded to do menial tasks like gather wood for you
-Realtime environmental population / repopulation i.e. two bunnys have chance to spawn a baby bunny if they collide
	- grass tiles can spread to dirt tiles over time expanding the grassy area;
	- animals will eat grass tiles turning them into dirt tiles and feeding themselfs
	- if user choses to kill all the animals in the local area the spawn rate will be masivly reduced and could be detrimental to the user

		INTRODUCTION
-Currently have been developing for one month and thought it would be best to start a regular log.
-Purpose of the log is to make development transparent to anyone intreseted in the project.
-Loging the projects development will improve organisation and allow me to focus my
 	efforts on the areas that need it the most.

-Main focus has been creation of base assets and API to construct the game with
-Map editor is one of the main tools that has been partialy developed over the past four weeks.

		MOVING FORWARD
-will maintain a weekly development log with all the notable game changes implemented over the week
-have a weekly goal section that details all the features I expect to have created and implemented by the end of the next week
	-this will allow me to highlight key areas that will be prioritised for development
